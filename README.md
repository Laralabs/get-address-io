## Laravel getAddress.io Package

This package allows you to easily interact with the [getAddress.io](https://getaddress.io/) API and cache full postcode results to reduce quota usage.

### Installation
Require the package in the `composer.json` of your project.
```
composer require laralabs/get-address-io
```
Publish the configuration file.
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=getaddress-config
```
Edit the configuration file and set your desired settings, the cache is disabled by default and you will need to set the following env variables:
```
GETADDRESS_API_KEY=
GETADDRESS_ADMIN_KEY=
```

If you have enabled the cache, make sure you run the migration:
```
php artisan migrate
```

### Usage
A helper function and facade is available, choose your preferred method.

Perform a lookup:
```php
$results = get_address()->find($postcode, $property);
```

Perform an expanded lookup:
```php
$results = get_address()->expand()->find($postcode, $property);
```

The `$property` argument is optional, just searching for a postcode will return all results for that postcode and also cache the data if the cache has been enabled.
